= perftest: Shell/Interpreters Performance Comparison

This repo is the shell/interpreter/language performance test.
This compares the running time of numerous interpreters and ranks them by speed.
The result is a nice little table, shown in results.txt

We time various languages in a simple task, that of
running "fmt", a simple text formatter that just fills lines to a
maximum length. Some versions written by previous Learning Tree Course 396
author Mike Woinowski. Java and Python versions by Ian Darwin.

Data files: small: 
		The source code (err, script) for the play
		"Two Gentlemen of Verona" by William Shakespeare (out of copyright!).
	Medium - two copies of small
	Large - 5 copies 

Use the Makefile: just run "make" and you should get all the stats.
